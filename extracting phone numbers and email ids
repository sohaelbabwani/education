#Python code to extract telephone numbers and email ids from given contacts given
#This code defines a function called extract_contacts_info that takes a list of contacts as input and returns a dictionary with two keys: "phone_numbers" and "email_addresses". The function uses regular expressions to match phone numbers and email addresses in each contact, and adds the matching strings to the appropriate lists in the dictionary.

import re

def extract_contacts_info(contacts):
    phone_pattern = re.compile(r"\b\d{3}[-.]?\d{3}[-.]?\d{4}\b")  # matches phone numbers in the format XXX-XXX-XXXX or XXX.XXX.XXXX or XXXXXXXXXX
    email_pattern = re.compile(r"\b[\w.-]+@[\w.-]+\.\w{2,}\b")  # matches email addresses in the format username@domain.com

    extracted_info = {"phone_numbers": [], "email_addresses": []}

    for contact in contacts:
        phone_match = phone_pattern.search(contact)
        if phone_match:
            extracted_info["phone_numbers"].append(phone_match.group())

        email_match = email_pattern.search(contact)
        if email_match:
            extracted_info["email_addresses"].append(email_match.group())

    return extracted_info
