num = int(input("Enter a number: ")) # get the input from user
factors = [] # create an empty list to store factors
for i in range(1, num + 1): # loop over all numbers from 1 to num
    if num % i == 0: # check if num is divisible by i
        factors.append(i) # add i to the list of factors
print("Factors of {} are {}".format(num, factors)) # print the result

# This code prints the prime numbers over a loop easily.
