# Change the range of possible numbers as necessary
low = 1 
high = 100

# Generate a random number in the range
answer = random.randint(low, high)

# Call the function to guess the number efficiently
steps = binary_search_guess(low, high, answer)
print(f"The number {answer} was guessed in {steps} steps.")
This code generates a random number between 1 and 100, and then uses a binary search approach to guess the number, taking the minimum amount of steps. You can change the range of possible numbers by adjusting the low and high variables.
